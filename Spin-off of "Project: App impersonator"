/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game 
that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data 
in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.
CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.*/


CREATE TABLE running_bud (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
        name TEXT,
        distance_km INTEGER, 
        minutes INTEGER);

INSERT INTO running_bud (name, distance_km, minutes) VALUES ('Alex', 5, 12);
INSERT INTO running_bud (name, distance_km, minutes) VALUES ('Xander', 10, 50);
INSERT INTO running_bud (name, distance_km, minutes) VALUES ('James', 25, 150);
INSERT INTO running_bud (name, distance_km, minutes) VALUES ('Connor', 8, 17);

UPDATE running_bud

WHERE name = 'Xander';

SELECT * FROM running_bud;

DELETE FROM running_bud
